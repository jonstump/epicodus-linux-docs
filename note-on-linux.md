# Deciding to use Linux

## Why take a coding course and learn a new operating system? Isn't that too much?
We tend to learn through connections. While you struggle through your coding venture you will also tie those struggles with learning a new operating system to this period of time as well. There is also a solid argument that it looks better on your resume.

## Isn't it complicated?
Learning any new system can be daunting. Over time if you do your reading and research on the installed package manager for your system and put in some effort into the terminal, one of your key tools as a developer, you will find that Linux starts to look a lot more simple.

## Okay but what distribution do I choose? Aren't there literally hundreds of them?
Oh easily. You can see all of the tracked distributions released over time [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Linux_Distribution_Timeline_27_02_21.svg)

What you will also notice looking at the timeline is that most distributions come from forks of other distributions. At the end of the day they really come down to the package manager, documentation, stable vs rolling release, and how "user friendly" of a distribution it may be. In user friendliness I might include things like how approachable the community and installed software are. Below you'll find some information on distributions regarding these notes that may be more accessible and helpful during your learning.

## Distribution suggestions

### Debian / Ubuntu based distributions

There is a particular reason that I pull out these distributions as the main focus as they are the distributions I have focused my knowledge on the most as someone learning more about the Linux environment. Ubuntu is a derivative of Debian, which has been around for some time and many modern day versions of Linux are forked from it and Ubuntu. The suggestions below are actually all forks of Ubuntu to my knowledge.

This gives a major benefit because it means that they share many systems and therefore share documentation. If you have an issue you can search for it in Ubuntu's documentation and forums. That will at least get you started. I also chose the ones below because they help make certain use cases on new users a little friendlier. Having a friendlier setup on the basics can help you not waste time on getting to simply know your desktop environment or how to find things in a settings menu. It's also nice not having to deal with having to install certain drivers if you need them. While the Linux kernel is generally the brain and heart of hardware to software management with many drivers in them, Linux does still have some proprietary drivers in its ecosystem that require installing. Some distros are okay with just doing this for you.

#### Ubuntu/Xubuntu/Kubuntu/lubuntu/

Vanilla Ubuntu is a good place for anyone to start. The differences in the above distributions is the desktop environment that they come packaged with. You may want to do a little research on these as some are similar to Windows and Mac giving you, sometimes much needed, familiarity in your new environment. When in doubt of what distribution to choose, base Ubuntu is a solid one. It has the added benefit of being backed by Canonical so there's a company behind the distribution.

Canonical has a lot of documentation on Ubuntu online and even offer professional support if need be for people using their products in the commercial space. If you want to learn more about Ubuntu in general you can look through their [help documentation found here](https://help.ubuntu.com). In fact that is a good resource for all of the following distros I will be talking about. All of them are Ubuntu based, so many of the problems you encounter might have solutions there.

#### Pop_OS

Pop_OS is a good choice if you've previously used a Mac since it uses Gnome/Cosmic as it's desktop environment.  In fact they even have documentation to make the transition to Pop_OS from MacOS easier. You can look it over [here](https://support.system76.com/articles/switch-from-macos-to-popos). It's very similar to MacOS in a handful of ways, where it differs is that it is very keyboard shortcut centric. It even offers a tiling window manager by default that you can easily toggle on and off. Some developers enjoy this type of environment because it keeps your hands on your keyboard and therefore could equate to more coding time. Some others don't prefer it thinking that it takes longer to relearn all of the specific keybaord shortcuts. Best thing about Pop_OS is that it is flexible enough to support either way of doing things out of the box. Pop_OS also benefits from being supported by a company via System76 and has lots of documentation specific to it on their website.

Pop_OS is also very good if you happen to have an nvidia graphics card. While Nvidia's drivers can be installed on pretty much any distribution, they are not user friendly to do so. Pop on the other hand has a version of their install ISO that includes these drivers. If you want to take advantage of your Nvidia Graphics card, Pop_OS is a solid option.

One other added benefit of Pop is that it comes preinstalled with a handful of developer applications you would end up installing anyways like git!

#### Zorin OS

Zorin OS is a newer distribution and is raved as a great alternative for people coming from Windows. Zorin may be slightly more resource intesive than some other distributions. It might not be recommended as a first choice for running Linux in a virtual machine.

#### Elementary OS

Elementary OS is a solid recommendation for someone coming from MacOS as it has a lot of similar design elemenets between their desktop environments.

#### Linux Mint

Linux Mint is considered one of the all time best beginner distributions. It's very friendly to pretty much any user making the transition over from another operating system. On its downloads page it includes three different desktop environments that are great for different reasons:

Cinnamon - Windows like
Mate - MacOS like
XFCE - Super light weight and great for virtual machines

#### Linux Lite

Linux Lite is a paired down version of linux that doesn't come preinstalled with a bunch of stuff. It's still very user friendly and is a great option if you want to run Linux in a virtual machine.
