# Deciding to use Linux

## Why take a coding course and learn a new operating system? Isn't that too much?
We tend to learn through connections. While you struggle through your coding venture you will also tie those struggles with learning a new operating system to this period of time as well. There is also a solid argument that it looks better on your resume.

## Isn't it complicated?
Learning any new system can be daunting. Over time if you do your reading and research on the installed package manager for your system and put in some effort into the terminal, one of your key tools as a developer, you will find that Linux starts to look a lot more simple.

## Okay but what distribution do I choose? Aren't there literally hundreds of them?
Oh easily. You can see all of the tracked distributions released over time [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Linux_Distribution_Timeline_27_02_21.svg)

What you will also notice looking at the timeline is that most distributions come from forks of other distributions. At the end of the day they really come down to the package manager, documentation, stable vs rolling release, and how "user friendly" of a distribution it may be. In user friendliness I might include things like how approachable the community and installed software are. Below you'll find some information on distributions regarding these notes that may be more accessible and helpful during your learning.
